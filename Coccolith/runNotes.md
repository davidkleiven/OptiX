# Run notes

| UID     | Parameters/Description | Results comments |
--------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
8228065 | No dispersion | First successfull run |
201727_9343 | No dispersion single frequency | Looks OK |
2017_2_7_9_58_29 | Spectrum no dispersion | Looks OK |
20170307_194951 | Trial run of spectrum visible light with dispersion | Was dispersion really on? No, it was not |
20170310_1643 | The simulation with dispersion seems to work fine! | Looks good |
20170312_1414 | First success full scattering cross section run | Max scattering 48 um^2 |
20170312_1849 | Scattering cross section with ne refractive index | minimum scattering coincide with cholorphyll spikes |
sphereCrossSectionRes8.h5 | Scattering cross secrion for a sphere with resolution 8 | Can be better |
20170320_08081 | Steady state of coccolith | Looks OK, used the epsilon for the ordinary axis. MEEP did not resolve all the details of the geometry |
20170321_1141 | Steady state simulation of coccolith at 30 degree incident angle. Think the threshold for the coccolith should be much nicer now. | Not analysed |
20170323_1838 | First computation with asymmetry factor | A little few frequencies |
20170324_1614 | 3 azimuthal angles, 64 theta | Should have more theta values, g factor seems to be wrong |
20170324_1848 | 3 azimuthal angles, 256 atheta | Oscillates rapidly |
20170328_0804 | CaCO3 coccolith scattering, Sr-distribution and asymmetry factor | Good results |
