| UID     | Parameters/Description | Results comments |
--------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
8228065 | No dispersion | First successfull run |
201727_9343 | No dispersion single frequency | Looks OK |
2017_2_7_9_58_29 | Spectrum no dispersion | Looks OK |
20170307_194951 | Trial run of spectrum visible light with dispersion | Was dispersion really on? No, it was not |
20170310_1643 | The simulation with dispersion seems to work fine! | Looks good |
20170312_1414 | First success full scattering cross section run | Max scattering 48 um^2 |
20170312_1849 | Scattering cross section with ne refractive index | minimum scattering coincide with cholorphyll spikes |
sphereCrossSectionRes8.h5 | Scattering cross secrion for a sphere with resolution 8 | Can be better |
20170320_08081 | Steady state of coccolith | Looks OK, used the epsilon for the ordinary axis. MEEP did not resolve all the details of the geometry |
20170321_1141 | Steady state simulation of coccolith at 30 degree incident angle. Think the threshold for the coccolith should be much nicer now. | Not analysed |
20170323_1838 | First computation with asymmetry factor | A little few frequencies |
20170324_1614 | 3 azimuthal angles, 64 theta | Should have more theta values, g factor seems to be wrong |
20170324_1848 | 3 azimuthal angles, 256 atheta | Oscillates rapidly |
20170328_0804 | CaCO3 coccolith scattering, Sr-distribution and asymmetry factor | Good results |
20170328_1332 | CaCO3 30 deg incidence angle | Good results |
20170328_1815 | CaCO3 45 deg angle | Good results |
20170329_1332 | Steady state 15 deg | Good results |
20170407_1329 | Steady 45 deg polarization Stokes vector test | Not analysed |
20170407_1543 | 45 degree polarization | Looks good |
20170407_1606 | Horizontal polarization (Ey) | Looks good |
20170407_1712 | Sphere horizontal polarization | U and V, zero Q/I varies... |
20170408_1620 | Sphere horizontal polarization | Q/I = 1 as it should be |
20170427_1007 | Sphere with mueller matrix | Looks OK, it shows a small azimuthal dependencies |
20170428_0732 | Coccoloith with mueller matrix | Strong peak effects |
20170428_2130 | Sphere better resolution, freq 0.03 +- 0.045 | OK, try with larger wavelength |
20170430_0706 | Sphere better resolution, freq 0.02 +0 0.03 | OK, 45 and 135 deg deviates a bit |
20170502_0200 | Mueller matrix for a coccolith | Looks OK |
20170505_1028 | Coccolith filled side | Scattering cross section is different form without |
20170505_1258 | Coccolith filled center | OK |
20170510_1921 | Coccolith original steady | OK |
20170510_2057 | Coccolith filled edges steady | OK |
20170510_2217 | Coccolith filled center steady | OK |
